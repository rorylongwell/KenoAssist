Apart from the pain {0} is in a good mood and the table has been moved to try and make it easier for {0} to get in and out of bed.

It has been cleaned with sterile water and cream for itch has being applied around the area. We have put a patch over it to prevent {0} scratching, although we are hoping to remove this in a few hours to see if the redness has went down any.
